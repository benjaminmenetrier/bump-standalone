# HDIAG_NICAS
Hybridization and localization diagnostics - Normalized Interpolated Convolution on an Adaptive Subgrid method

The HDIAG_NICAS software is a computer program whose purpose is to estimate localization functions and hybridization coefficients for covariance models used in ensemble-variational data assimilation systems, and to prepare coefficients to apply normalized interpolated convolution from adaptive subgrids.
